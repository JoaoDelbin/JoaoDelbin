Hi, I'm JoÃ£o! I create digital experiences that combine functionality, beauty and purpose.

My skills include web development with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as knowledge in UX/UI Design to ensure every project is intuitive, visually appealing, and functional.

Recently, I had my first web development experience, building landing pages as a freelancer for a major fashion company. Through my studies in UX/UI, Iâ€™ve been exploring the "why" behind every design decision, always striving to bring lightness and intentionality to what I create.

I also use Python as a tool for automations and data analysis, which helps me optimize processes and bring more efficiency to my projects.

If you have a project in mind or just want to chat, feel free to reach out! I'm available for new opportunities. ðŸ˜Š
